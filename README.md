## Key Benefits

- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently, making your life as a developer much easier.

- **Maintainability**: Making changes or adding new features becomes a breeze.

- **Scalability**: As your app grows, Clean Architecture helps you keep things organized and prevents it from turning into a big ball of mud.




## Lessons Learned

Clean Architecture is a guideline, not a rigid set of rules. Feel free to adapt it to your specific needs.

**Getting Started**:

- **Start with the Domain Layer**: Identify the core use cases of your app. What problems is it solving?

- **Define your Data Layer**: What data do you need, and where will you get it from?

- **Build your Presentation Layer**: Use SwiftUI to create a beautiful and intuitive user interface.
